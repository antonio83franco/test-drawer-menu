Left drawer menu for HTML5 game


1. Evil Game:

    - Please use the attached game.
    - Add a *responsive* slide-over menu, that can be opened by the user at any point of the game.
    - The menu should include: More Games Link to our portal (http://m.softgames.de ) and ability to rate the game on a
    5-star-rating scale and buttons to share it on facebook and twitter.
    - the connection/sharing-functionality to facebook and twitter can be left out for now, but you should know how to do it.
    - Provide callbacks for the link and rating so it can be extended to
    do some API-calls (for tracking purposes etc.) - (for now its enough to alert some dummy message)

    Notices:
    - Use HTML5 and CSS3
    - We're mobile/tablet focused
    - Send us the result via zip or share on your github-account

    Good luck mighty hero
